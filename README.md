# CIS221-Course---My-Analytics-Application-Experience-

### 3.1 Challenges I Experienced

I struggled with cleaning and understanding the data during EDA, interpreting statistical outputs in inferential regression, and choosing/tuning the right model for machine learning. I also had issues with errors in the code and handling different data types.

### 3.2 Reasons Why It Happened & What I Learned

These happened because I’m still getting used to the analysis process and the theories behind regression. Some mistakes came from messy data, unclear assumptions, and lack of practice. I learned that I need to check data quality first, understand model assumptions, and follow a proper workflow to avoid confusion and errors.

### 3.3 What I Need to Do Better Next Time

I need to clean the data more carefully, review regression concepts, organize my code, and practice more with preprocessing and model selection so I can work faster and with fewer mistakes.
